The basic idea for this project is to build a hotel website, with features such as user login and registration, room viewing through pics and availability checking, reservation and cancellation, etc. Residents will have options to order meals from an available menu, request hotel staff for any repairs, cleaning, changing sheets etc., and can schedule them to visit at a particular time. An admin login will also be added with the ability to create new admins, create or delete reservations, manage the hotel staff, dispatch services to rooms as necessary, etc. Services such as catering and housekeeping could have their own portals as well to view request from residents. Further features will be added as required.
